Once upon a time there was a girl named Betty. Twelve year old Betty lived in a lovely house overlooking a lake in Upstate New York. Betty loved to have picnics with her family and go kayaking on the lake.
One day, Betty was out on the lake with her family when a magical loon appeared. The loon told Betty that she could make three wishes, and Betty wished for a pony, two dollars, and a crowbar. The loon, disgusted by Betty's lack of ambition, exploded. Betty and her family never kayaked again.
