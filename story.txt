Once upon a time there was a girl named Betty. Twelve year old Betty lived in
a lovely house overlooking a lake in Upstate New York. Betty loved to have
picnics with her family and go kayaking on the lake.
One day, Betty was out on the lake with her family when a magical loon appeared. 
The loon told Betty that she could make three wishes, and Betty wished for a 
pony, two dollars, and a crowbar. The loon, disgusted by Betty's lack of 
ambition, exploded. Betty and her family never kayaked again. Two months later, 
when they returned to the lake for a walk, the loon was lying there basking in 
the sun. They were so angry at the memory of two months ago that they gave the 
loon a good beating.Betty and her family then lived happily ever after!
The end!
